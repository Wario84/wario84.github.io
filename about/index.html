		<div class="about">
			<h1>About</h1>
			<p>I'm a PhD candidate of the Programme on Innovation, Economics and Governance for Development (IEGD) at <a href="http://www.merit.unu.edu/training/iegd/">UNU-MERIT</a>. 

I have developed and implemented algorithms for data cleaning and analysis and I have vast experience using R. I know how to use regular expressions to work with big sets of unstructured raw-data (most common in the industry) for analysis and text mining. I believe that the best way to tackle big data is by efficient programming, parsimony (look for the simplest solution that yields the best result) and parallelization to optimize CPU usage. I have experience working in teams, but I'm a self-learner capable of conducting independent projects and research. I have the great advantage of having experience teaching and tutoring statistics, econometrics and data science in my faculty at the master and doctorate level.</p>
