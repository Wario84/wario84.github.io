<h1>My Research</h1>

    <h2>Interests</h2>
    <p>I am interested in applying quantitative methods and data science to understand economics of science and innovation. 

    <h2>Data Science in R</h2>
    <p>I have developed and implemented several algorithms for data cleaning and analysis and I have vast experience using R. In particular, I have used regular expressions and fuzzy-matching functions to work with big sets of unstructured raw-data (most common in the industry) for analysis and text mining.  I have also good knowledge of RSelenium, which allows me to gather and harness big data from the web. I know how to optimize the production of reports combining novel visualizations with R and Latex to generate reproducible documents. My programming principles are readable and efficient coding, parsimony (look for the simplest solution that yields the best result) and parallelization to optimize CPU usage. 
    </p>

    <h2>Network Analysis</h2>
    <p> I have performed network analysis to get insights into how collaboration works. I have vast experience manipulating data to disentangle different layers or communities within one network. I am very knowledgable in generating and interpreting network variables and also plotting and highlighting different network structures.
     </p>    
       
    <h2>Bibliometrix</h2>        
    <p>I have worked with bibliometrics to produce measurements of scientific productivity based on publications and scientific impact based on citations. I have also implemented algorithms for author level name disambiguation. Furthermore, I have used bibliometric data and text mining to get insights into how knowledge from collaboration flows:    across countries, disciplines or institutions?         
        </p>
    <h2> Statistics and Econometrics </h2>
    <p>I'm very knowledgable about descriptive and inferential statistics. I have applied matching and resampling algorithms to compare individuals using the first order stochastic dominance framework. I have also applied panel data econometrics to control for time-invariant unobserved heterogeneity and perform the Generalized Method of Moments (GMM) estimation to address issues of endogeneity. I have also used ordinal regression to estimate the effects of prestige and academic mobility on performance. Currently, I am working on a multilayer model, where an equation of ability is linked with a selection equation to explain performance in the last level, using Monte Carlo Markov Chain (MCMC) framework.
