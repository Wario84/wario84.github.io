			<h1>About</h1>
			<p>I'm a PhD candidate of the Programme on Innovation, Economics and Governance for Development (IEGD) at <a href="http://www.merit.unu.edu/training/iegd/">UNU-MERIT</a>. I'm passionate about data analysis using  R. During my research I have learnt great tools and techniques from data science that I will like to share. For instance, I have used Regular Expressions (Regex) and Fuzzy Matching to perform string analysis and disambiguate names of authors. I have used data mining by setting up a web driver and control virtual browsers to get data from the internet. I know how to integrate and prepare data for statistical analysis, in particular for econometric application, I hope that you will find my blog useful.</p>
