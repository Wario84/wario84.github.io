			<h1>About</h1>
			<p>Hi there! I'm a PhD candidate of Programme on Innovation, Economics and Governance for Development (IEGD) <a href="http://www.merit.unu.edu/training/iegd/">UNU-MERIT</a>. I'm doing research on scientific networks and for the moment I have been using R for almost everything... I would like to share what I have learned, maybe it can help you to facilitate the process of reading, analysis and visualisation of data. I will focus on common bibliometric databases such as Web of Science (WOS).   .</p>
